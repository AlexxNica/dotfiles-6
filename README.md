# My .dotfiles

Not too much here, trying to keep configuration management in other places.

## Setup
### Automatic
Usually managed by the `dotfiles:install` task v3 of
[mroth/bootstrapper](http://github.com/mroth/bootstrapper), so don't worry man.

### Manual

  1. [Install _homeshick_][homeshick-install].
  2. `homeshick clone https://github.com/mroth/dotfiles.git`
  3. `homeshick link dotfiles`

To update, do `homeshick pull dotfiles`.
